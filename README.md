# Jasmine Test Project

This is a project to demonstrate the browser based testing of Jasmine

## How to run

To run the testing, simply open the <code>index.html</code>file.
Results will be diplayed in a Jasmine banner at the bottom of the webpage. 
All tests should pass. 
Modifying the html/css/js files will allow the user to see Jasmine pickup errors.
